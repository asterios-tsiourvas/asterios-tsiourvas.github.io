<span style="font-size: 0.9em;">I am a 4th year PhD candidate in Operations Research at MIT, where I am advised by [Georgia Perakis](https://mitmgmtfaculty.mit.edu/gperakis/). My research lies in the intersection of deep learning and discrete optimization with applications in neural networks optimization, causal ML, counterfactual explanations, hierarchical time series, LLMs, and healthcare. </span>

<span style="font-size: 0.9em;">Before that, I did my masters in Data Science & Machine Learning at the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), Greece, advised by [Manolis Georgoulis](http://www.math.ntua.gr/~georgoulis/) and [Michail Loulakis](http://www.math.ntua.gr/~loulakis/info/Home.html). I did my undergrad in Electrical and Computer Engineering at NTUA, advised by [Nektarios Koziris](http://www.cslab.ntua.gr/~nkoziris/).</span>

<span style="font-size: 0.9em;">My work is supported by IBM Research, the Onassis Foundation and the Foundation for Education and European Culture.</span>
